## React Native Prime

Install all dependencies as states in the [React Native docs under the "React Native CLI Quickstart" section](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started "React Native Docs").
Also install xCode and Android Studio as suggested in the docs.

Before you start install the project dependencies with `npm install`.
Next you can run the project for the playform of choice:
1. `react-native run-ios`
2. `react-native run-android`

This will start the project with the correct emulator. After that you can run the project with `react-native start --reset-cache` to always get the latest version and use the emulator which is already active.

#### Tips
1. Use the `react-native-debugger` [See the Github page](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger)
2. Don't forget to test on real devices every now and then
3. Enable Hot Module Reloading in your emulator. On Android press `CMD + M` on iOS `CMD + D`.
4. For SVG's use `react-native-svg`, easily convert SVG's with [this SVGR tool](https://www.smooth-code.com/open-source/svgr/playground/).
